Phase 1: Implement a PolyTreeNode class
Write a class with four methods:
An #initialize(value) method that sets the value, and starts parent as nil, and children to an empty array.
A #parent method that returns the node's parent.
A #children method that returns an array of children of a node.
A #value method that returns the value stored at the node.
Write a #parent= method which (1) sets the parent property and (2) adds the node to their parent's array of children (unless we're setting parent to nil).
Run bundle exec rspec to run the provided tests. At this point, all the specs for #initialize and most of the specs for #parent= should pass. (We'll get to the other specs soon!)
